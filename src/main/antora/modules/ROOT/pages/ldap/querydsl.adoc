= QueryDSL Support
Basic QueryDSL support is included in Spring LDAP. This support includes the following:

* An Annotation Processor, `LdapAnnotationProcessor`, for generating QueryDSL classes based on Spring LDAP ODM annotations.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/{springLdapVersion}/reference/#odm[Object-Directory Mapping] for more information on the ODM annotations.
* A Query implementation, `QueryDslLdapQuery`, for building and running QueryDSL queries in code.
* Spring Data repository support for QueryDSL predicates. `QueryDslPredicateExecutor` includes a number of additional methods with appropriate parameters.
You can extend this interface (along with `LdapRepository`) to include this support in your repository.
